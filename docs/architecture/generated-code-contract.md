# Generated-code contract

Generated source must be production-quality Java.

## Rules

1. Generated model types are immutable by default.
2. Use Java records for simple data-structure complex types where appropriate.
3. Use final classes/builders when records are unsuitable.
4. Use sealed interfaces or tagged types for choices where feasible.
5. Use defensive copies for repeated elements.
6. Maintain null-free collection invariants.
7. Do not use runtime annotations for binding behavior.
8. Do not use reflection for construction, property access, or codec dispatch.
9. Do not rely on classpath scanning or ServiceLoader in generated runtime paths.
10. Generated source must pass formatting and static analysis.
